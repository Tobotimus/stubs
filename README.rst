This repository is just going to contain a couple of stubs for various libraries. These stubs can be used by static type checkers (like `mypy`_) to help prevent errors in your code.

.. _`mypy`: https://github.com/python/mypy

Guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^
These stubs use python 3.6+ syntax. That's all for now.

Currently stubbed libraries
